        When you think about writing headlines for your marketing materials, do you think, “Easy! They’re super short!
        We can totally handle this in-house.”?<br><br>
        Maybe. <br><br>But if you’re interested in increasing conversions, don’t assume that the short stuff is simple
        to write. Here’s why.
      </p>
      <h3>1) Sometimes headlines are ALL they read</h3>
      <p>
        You want people to read your content. But they’ll never even make it to your content if the headline doesn’t
        pull them in. According to
        <a href="#">Copyblogger</a>, 8 out of 10 people read ONLY the headline. What?! <br><br>
        Are your in-house writers experts in buyer psychology? Do you have effective, streamlined methods for testing
        word choice? Can you hone in on that one, perfect headline that results in the most revenue? If not, you might
        want to consider enlisting the help of our expert writers.
      </p>
      <h3>2) Headlines are the sexy librarians of copywriting</h3>
      <p>
        They have all the knowledge, but they share only a small part of it. And then there’s the appeal that makes you
        want more.
        <br><br>
        A headline is a heavy-lifter. It has to share just enough information without giving away too much. And maybe
        even tap into some emotions.
        <br><br>
        In short: don’t be fooled by its brevity. Behind every winning headline is a good writer…and a lot of
        experience.
      </p>
      <h3>3) Honesty is the best policy. No, really</h3>
      <p>
        Achieving the perfect balance of honesty and intrigue is an artform. A headline needs to be honest to your brand
        identity. And your headlines need to have honest relationships with ALL the rest of marketing materials.
        <br><br>
        Inexperienced writers might think that sensational headlines get attention. Sometimes they do. But to close a
        sale and increase your bottom line, you need much more than attention.
        <br><br>
        While you want your headlines to grab attention, they need to remain believable. Sensational headlines don’t
        create trust, and often don’t result in sales.
        <br><br>
        A few years back, <a href="#">Boredpanda</a> compiled a list of misleading headlines. While most of the
        headlines on that list are good for a laugh, they are pretty harmless. They’re not outright lies. They don’t
        bait-and-switch like some headlines do.
        <br><br>
        Please, don’t write headlines that make you look like a liar or a laughingstock.
      </p>
      <h3>4) Conversions don’t happen accidentally</h3>
      <p>
        Writing good copy doesn’t happen magically. It’s not good luck. Conversions are created when there’s synergy
        within your marketing materials. Buyers can’t push the “buy now” button if they never get to your landing page.
        They never arrive at your landing page if they don’t first read the…you guessed it! Headline. Conversions depend
        on good copy, and good copy starts with a headline.
        <br><br>

        materials you need - from headlines all the way to “buy now.” If you’re ready to supercharge your digital
