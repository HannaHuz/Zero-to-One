        Like an iceberg, the bulk of great copy happens way below the surface. <br><br>
        Powerful sales copy that inspires your audience to buy your product or service happens one step at a time.
        <br><br>
        But…do you even know what that first step is? <br><br>
        Even amazing copywriters who can crank out a 600-word advertorial that converts like a machine have to start
        their process way before the first word or headline is written.
        <br><br>
        It all starts with research and analysis.
      </p>
      <h3>Why Research?</h3>
      <p>An agency, media buyer, or brand owner can show me a product, and maybe even tell me who they believe their audience is, but to motivate the right audience, I need to know them. I need to understand them. I need to have an idea of what makes them tick.
        <br><br>
        Good research invokes ideas and gives the copywriter the greatest gift in the world. The true key to writing the type of ads that get results is empathy.
        <br><br>
        Empathy is being able to put oneself in another’s shoes. For example, it’s way easier to have a 70-year-old woman connect with what she’s reading if I know how to communicate in her language.</p>
      <h3>Is All Research Equal?</h3>
      <p>
        Research starts out simple. What is the product? Does the client know the audience or have one in mind? What
        makes the product unique, according to the client?
        <br><br>
        Once those questions are asked and answered, the next step is to dive into actual public opinion. A quality
        agency has ways of finding consumer attitudes. At 021, we understand what your audience wants, and what they’re
        thinking, because we go deep into buyer psychology and researching them.
      </p>
      <h3>Research, Then Writing?</h3>
      <p>
        No, this is still too early in the process to write a word. The next step is analysis and strategy. You might
        have the information, but do you understand it?
        <br><br>
        Analysis is important because it lets the writer absorb the information. Strategy takes that information and
        puts a plan in place.
      </p>
      <h3>Now…It’s Time To Write</h3>
      <p>
        Finally, at this stage, it’s time to write. The best sales copy you’ve ever read was NOT written by someone who
        just sat down at a keyboard and started typing. It was written by a master, a guru who took the time to
        understand the audience before the first word was even considered.
        <br><br>
        So when deciding on which agency you want to write your copy, or when considering how to put together a winning
        advertorial that gets amazing conversions, CPA and CPM, think first about the research.

        <li>Where do you start?</li>
        <li>Who has all the information you’re looking for?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Only effective agencies can answer those questions.</p>
